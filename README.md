# Selfhosted-file-sync-Pi-project

This README contains a complete write-up of the steps and processes I did to set up and run a fully encrypted, self-hosted file synchronization system on a Raspberry Pi 5 using Syncthing. It documents the problem that led to the project, the hardware and software used, the installation and configuration process, and the final outcome.

## Why I Started This Project - The problem I was having

I created this self-hosted file synchronization system to solve a challenge I faced during my Computer Science NEA. We were allowed to bring in our own portable computers and use an IDE of our choice â€” mine being PyCharm, which is not available on the school system. Since I only have a desktop PC and an iPad (which cannot run Python and Tkinter due to App Store restrictions), I needed an alternative solution.

To work around this, I set up remote access to my Raspberry Pi from sixth form using Pi Connect, allowing me to code on it directly. I then added automated, encrypted file synchronization between the Pi and my desktop PC using Syncthing, eliminating the need to repeatedly upload files to Google Drive or other cloud storage services.

## What is Syncthing
Syncthing is a free file synchronization service which allows you to share files across a load of different computers, with a peer to peer method rather than client to server method. Allows you to mirror folders across computers.

## Hardware and Software I used

- Raspberry Pi 5 (8gb)
- Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)
- Pi connect
- Syncthing
- Pycharm

## Installation Process

First I installed the latest [Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) version onto the SD card via my PC and the Imager application.

To install Pi-connect I ran the following commands: `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt full-upgrade`. After everything was checked and installed I then ran `sudo apt install rpi-connect` which installed Pi connect itself. I then logged into my Pi connect account to enable me to connect remotly from my desktop or Ipad without the need for the Pi to be plugged into a screen.

### Syncthing

To start the install of [Syncthinhg](https://syncthing.net/), in the command prompt I ran `sudo apt install syncthing` which installs everything I need. Then I run syncthing for first time via `syncthing` which setups up everything ready for later. To stop it again I pressed `Ctrl + C`.
To be able to access the web GUI I needed to change the .config file in the Sync folder. So I ran `ls` to find the sync folder on my Pi. Once I found it, I ran `sudo vim .config/syncthing/config.xml`. In the config file I went to find `<gui`, under address and changed the IP to `0.0.0.0:8384` to allow any device on my network able to access it. Also making sure my router is not forwading the port to outside the firewall.

I then exited and saved the nano .config edits, back to the comnmand promt i ran  `syncthing` again, this time I am able to access it from my web browser by typing `raspberrypi.local:8384`

On the browser GUI it prompted me to setup a GUI authentication username and password, which I did.

I then installed [Syncthing's Windows app](https://syncthing.net/downloads/) to add a computer to the Syncthing file sharing network. Once I had installed it 2 new icons appear in the start menu, one for start and one for stop. I clicked start and it automattically opens the Desktop IP GUI on the web browser because im still on the local network.

## Setting up and connecting 

On the new tab that opened I clicked add remote device, it then asks for a device ID. So I went back into the Raspberry Pi browser tab, went to Actions > Show ID, then at the top there was a long string of characters or a QR code so I copied the ID and pasted it back into the Desktop tab. Then under sharing I checked the box which said Introducer which means it can share folders with the Desktop. When going back onto the Pi there was a request for the new device to connect, making sure it was my desktop I clicked  '+ Add Device'.

Before adding any data, I made sure everything was secure by going to Actions > Settings > Connections and disabled NAT transversal and Global discovery on both Desktop and Pi, so only local people could connect to it. For the changes to take place I restarted Syncthing on both sides.

I created a new folder called Shared Code, and in the settings check the box which says 'Share with Desktop'. Under advanced I changed the full scan interval to every 1 hour rather than the defualt 30 minutes and clicked save.

Back on the desktop tab there was a request which said 'Pi wants to share a folder with desktop', I clicked 'Add' and under folder path put the shared code folder under my pre-existing code folder on my computer.

## Testing 

On my desktop I added a .txt document called 'test' to the 'Shared Code' folder in file explorer, and then forced a rescan on the GUI. Went back to my raspberry Pi screen sharing on Pi connect opened the folder and it had successfully worked.

For syncthing to open when the Pi comes online I had to enable the syncthing service, by running `sudo systemctl enable syncthing@pi.service`. I then rebooted the Pi, went to the web browser GUI to see that syncthing started up on its own after the restart.

## Pycharm

To install the IDE [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) I went to the [Downloads](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=linux) page on their website, and selected linux as Pi OS is a debian based Linux distribution. Once I had downloaded the the .tar.gz file, I extracted it and then executed the `Pycharm.sh` file. To make it so I dont have to go to the file everytime I want to use Pycharm, when it opened I clicked in the bottom left create desktop shortcut, which added it to the programming section in my Pi.
